# Solidity Interfaces

> [!NOTE]
> The recommended pattern by the authors of this repo is to <u>colocate interfaces with their implementations</u> in the same directory. This is because interfaces are often updated in lockstep with their implementations and this aids with maintainability.

This [`interfaces/`](../interfaces/) directory is a useful place to store interfaces which cross-cut multiple contracts.
