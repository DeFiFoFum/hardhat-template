## 📁 Markdown Architecture

### 📂 Directory Structure

```
docs/
├── index-docs.md
├── section1/
│   ├── index-section1.md
│   ├── topic1.md
│   └── topic2.md
└── subsection2/
    ├── index-subsection2.md
    ├── topic3.md
    └── topic4.md
```

### 📋 Index File Requirements

Each directory must contain an index file named `index-<foldername>.md` that serves as:

1. Navigation hub
2. Content overview
3. Quick reference

Example index file structure:

```markdown
---
title: Section Name Overview
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# 🎯 Section Name Documentation

Brief introduction to contents...

## 📑 Navigation
- [Topic 1](./topic1.md)
  - [Subtopic 1.1](./topic1.md#subtopic-11)
  - [Subtopic 1.2](./topic1.md#subtopic-12)
- [Topic 2](./topic2.md)
  - [Subtopic 2.1](./topic2.md#subtopic-21)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Index files should provide context and relationships between documents, not just links.

### 🔄 Navigation Rules

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Root Index] --> B[Section Index]
    B --> C[Individual Documents]
    C --> B
    B --> A
```

1. Every document must link back to its parent index
2. Every section must link to the root index
3. All headers must have "Back to Top" links
4. Use relative links for all internal navigation
