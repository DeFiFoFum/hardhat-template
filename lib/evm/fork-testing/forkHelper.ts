/**
 * Sets up a network fork for testing purposes.
 *
 * This function is used to simulate a fork of a specified blockchain network at a given block number.
 * It can be useful for testing contracts and interactions in a controlled environment that mirrors
 * the state of the main network at a specific point in time.
 *
 * @param networkName The name of the network to fork. This should match one of the network names
 *                    configured in the Hardhat configuration file (hardhat.config.ts).
 * @param blockNumber The block number at which to fork the network. This allows you to set the state
 *                    of the forked network to that of the main network at the specified block.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * // To fork the mainnet at block number 12345678
 * await setupFork('mainnet', 12345678);
 * // To fork 'latest', omit the block number
 * await setupFork('mainnet');
 * ```
 *
 * Note: After calling this function, you will be interacting with a local version of the specified
 * network that starts at the given block number. Any transactions or calls you make will be
 * reflected in this local fork and will not affect the actual network.
 *
 * Throws an error if the RPC URL for the specified network is not found in the Hardhat configuration.

/**
 * Resets the local fork to its original state.
 *
 * This function is used to reset the state of the local forked network to its original state before any transactions
 * or calls were made. This can be useful when you want to run multiple tests in succession without interference from
 * the changes made in previous tests.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * // To reset the forked network to its initial state
 * await resetFork();
 * ```
 *
 * Note: After calling this function, the local fork will be in the same state as it was immediately after the
 * original call to `setupFork`. Any transactions or calls made after the fork was set up will be undone.
